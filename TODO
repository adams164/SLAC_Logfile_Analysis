Old frustration metric:
	+-3 terms compared to last non-identical search

Idea:
	Split term up into keyword-value pairs
	Compare number of keywords--not identical = not similar
	Number of keywords the same: compare values (levenshtein)
	
	Frustration marked by percentage of searches which are frustrated--?
	

Do country analysis things.
	Bar graph recreation >_<
